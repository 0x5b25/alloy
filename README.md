## A cross platform C++ low level graphics API library heavily inspired by Metal/Vulkan API.

Previously inspired by [.NET Veldrid](https://github.com/mellinoe/veldrid) library. The main shader support is DXIL, given Apple now have an official way to transpile DXIL to MSL binary.

Target is to support modern APIs as backends, that is Vulkan/Metal/DX12 and cross desktop(Windows/MacOS) and mobile(iOS/Android).

Vulkan API as first citizen, with added ease-of-use from metal API.

Currently under construction. A lot of code is borrowed from original Veldrid library.
