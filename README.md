# veldridcpp
## A cross platform C++ low level graphics API library heavily inspired by Veldrid.

My personal take on the [.NET Veldrid](https://github.com/mellinoe/veldrid) library. Loosely follows the original interface, not a strict 1:1 port. Added some personal touches here and there. I view this library as the new foundation to my future personal projects, replacing the make-do vulkan wrapper I currently use, which I found increasingly difficult to maintain or modify.

Targets modern API, that is Vulkan and Metal(thanks apple). DX12 might be added in the future.

Vulkan API as first citizen, metal support will be added shortly afterwards. DX12 is in the stretch goals.

Currently under construction. A lot of code is borrowed from original Veldrid library.
